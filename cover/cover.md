Curiosity has been the defining quality of my academic and professional journey, shaping my path through my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.
Now, as I call NYC home, I am immersed in exciting research at the intersection of Finance and Computer Science under the mentorship of Prof. Sivaraman at NYU. Our work focuses on distributed low-latency networking in the context 
of a cloud-based financial exchange, where we are developing heuristics to optimize VM selection for enhanced network performance.

Throughout my career, I have explored a diverse range of topics in both industry and academia, from embedded systems and machine learning on edge devices to my current work on cloud-based distributed systems. This breadth of experience reflects my adaptability and eagerness to embrace new challenges. Along the way, I have honed my ability to distill complex technical problems into their fundamental components, and incrementally build solutions that drive towards the intended goals.
Whether it was developing FPGA and SoC systems, optimizing distributed machine learning models, or designing efficient network communication across cloud clusters, I have consistently recognized common patterns underlying engineering challenges. These experiences have taught me to approach problems with a methodical and analytical mindset, enabling me to navigate technical complexity and deliver impactful solutions.

I am also confident in my ability to communicate effectively, bridging technical details and big-picture insights to enable collaboration across teams. 
Furthermore, as a dual American and Brazilian citizen, my multicultural background and versatile experiences further equip me to thrive in diverse environments. 
My passion for learning and growth drives me, and I am eager to contribute to your organization with the same dedication and curiosity that have defined my journey so far.

<!-- My journey demonstrates my ability to adapt to new environments and equips me with the tools needed to tackle any problem that comes my way. -->
<!-- Given my technical expertise, multicultural background and unique profile, I am confident I’ll be -->

<!-- Recently, I have developed a keen interest in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and the sophisticated computing infrastructures that underpin our modern financial systems. The unique engineering challenges presented by low-latency trading are particularly fascinating to me, encompassing a diverse range of technical domains such as FPGA development, advanced networking, compiler optimizations, and intricate machine learning techniques. This convergence of disciplines to address the complexities of HFT exemplifies the kind of multifaceted problem-solving that I find deeply engaging. Additionally, I am equally intrigued by the broader implications of this work, including its impact on our economy, the incentives it creates, and its role in the interconnected fabric of global finance. Understanding these dynamics offers a comprehensive view of how technological advancements in trading are shaping financial markets worldwide. -->
